Scope:
Distributed Processing:

Task Content:
We have a building with a freight elevator leading to the top floor. Process-suppliers
want to get to the top. One way they carry X-kilogram loads, back they always
take up 1 seat.
The elevator has a maximum load capacity of N kg.

Description:
The program handles communication between threads that are trying to access different sections.
Thanks to the use of the Lamport Clock, we are able to prevent jamming despite distributed communication.

Technology:
C, MPI

Launch:
1. It is necessary to have a system on which the support of MPI is implemented.
2. You need to run the Macfile by calling the command: make -f Makefile test .

Effect:
After launching, we will see the flow of information between processes and how they access different sections.
